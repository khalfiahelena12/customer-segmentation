In today’s competitive markets companies have to focus on customers’ needs, wants, attitudes, behaviors, preferences, and perceptions, shifting from the old “designbuild-sell” marketing model to the customer-oriented view of relation marketing. Customer segmentation is defined as the process of dividing customers into distinct, meaningful, and homogeneous subgroups based on various attributes and characteristics. It is used as differentiating marketing tool. It enables organizations to understand their customers and build differentiated strategies, tailored to their characteristics. This concept Is further explained as a process that divides customers into smaller groups called segments.


Credit card providers usually target users using their behavior and demographic information. Behaviors are often based on credit reports on how a person spends and pays over time. Customer segmentation is the technique of separating a customer base into particular groups of persons. A client segmentation model allows consumers to efficiently differentiate themselves and provides issuers with insights into how their cards may be used more or attract new customers via innovative systems.
Card issuers can not only make higher-priced proposals, but can discover groups that have poorly serviced by present offers, using improved segmentation. Their behavioral style can help study these groups and provide better alternatives and strategies to meet their demands.

**Problem Statement**
This data contains of several variables related to customer's behavior. To give recommendations to the companies, we need to segment the data to give appropriate treatment.So the problem statement is how many cluster will be formed? What is the difference between every clusters?

**Objective**
On this Project we will distinguish customer into several groups or cluster to determine the appropriate treatment. Then decide the right strategy for every cluster.

**Data Collection**
This case requires to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables. The data can be accessed in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata
